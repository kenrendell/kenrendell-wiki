# Non-Inverting Amplifier (Op Amp)

> A ***non-inverting amplifier*** is an [op amp](bd63e87b.md) circuit designed to provide a positive voltage gain.

The input voltage $v_i$ is applied directly at the non-inverting input terminal, and resistor $R_1$ is connected between the ground and the inverting terminal.

If feedback resistor $R_f = 0$ (short circuit) or $R_1 = \infty$ (open circuit) or both, the gain becomes 1. This is called a *[voltage follower](dc4db14e.md)* (or *unity gain amplifier*) because the output follows the input.
