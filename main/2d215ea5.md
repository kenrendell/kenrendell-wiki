# Signal Operations

Commonly used operations on signals include transformations of amplitude or time:

- ***Amplitude scaling*** of $x(t)$ by $C$ multiplies all signal values by constant $C$.

  > $\boxed{x(t) \to C\,x(t)}$

- An ***amplitude shift*** adds a constant $K$ to $x(t)$. 

  > $\boxed{x(t) \to K + x(t)}$

- A ***time shift*** displaces a signal $x(t)$ in time without changing its shape.

  > $\boxed{x(t) \to x(t - \alpha)}\quad\textrm{(delayed, shifted right by }\alpha\textrm{)}$
  >
  > $\boxed{x(t) \to x(t + \alpha)}\quad\textrm{(advanced, shifted left by }\alpha\textrm{)}$
  >
  > where $\alpha > 0$

- ***Time scaling*** speeds up or slows down time and results in signal compression or expansion.

  > $\boxed{x(t) \to x(\alpha t)}\quad\textrm{(compressed, speeded up to }\alpha t\textrm{)}$
  >
  > $\boxed{x(t) \to x\left(t / \alpha\right)}\quad\textrm{(expanded, slowed down to }t / \alpha\textrm{)}$
  >
  > where $\alpha > 1$

  > Note that shifting or folding a signal $x(t)$ will not change its area or energy, but time scaling $x(t)$ to $x(\alpha t)$ will reduce both its area and energy by $|\alpha|$.

- ***Reflection*** or ***folding*** or ***time reversal*** is just a scaling operation with $\alpha = -1$. It creates the folded signal $x(-t)$ as a mirror image to $x(t)$ about the vertical axis passing through the origin $t = 0$.

  > $\boxed{x(t) \to x(-t)}$

The signal $y(t) = x(\alpha t - \beta)$ may be generated from $x(t)$ by plotting $x(t)$ against a new time axis $t_n$.

> $\displaystyle x(t) = x(\alpha t_n - \beta) \to \boxed{t = \alpha t_n - \beta}$
>
> $\boxed{t_n = \frac{1}{\alpha}(t + \beta)}$

## Combined Operations

The most general operation involving all the three operations (shift, scale, and reflect) is $x(\alpha t - \beta)$, which is realized in two possible sequences of operation:

- Time shift $x(t)$ by $\beta$ to obtain $x(t - \beta)$. Then time scale the shifted signal $x(t - \beta)$ by $\alpha$ to obtain $x(\alpha t - \beta)$.
- Time scale $x(t)$ by $\alpha$ to obtain $x(\alpha t)$. Then time shift the scaled signal $x(\alpha t)$ by $\beta / \alpha$ to obtain $x[\alpha(t - \beta / \alpha)] = x(\alpha t - \beta)$.

In either case, if $\alpha$ is negative, time scaling involves time reversal.
