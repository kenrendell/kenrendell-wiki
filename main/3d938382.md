# Power Factor Correction

Most domestic loads (such as washing machines, air conditioners, and refrigerators) and industrial loads (such as induction motors) are inductive and operate at a low lagging [power factor](0e5be61b.md).

An inductive load is modeled as a series combination of an [inductor](8be49ac8.md) and a resistor.

> The process of increasing the power factor without altering the voltage or current to the original load is known as ***power factor correction***.

Consider the power triangle. If the original inductive load has [apparent power](0e5be61b.md) $S_1$.

To increase the power factor from $\cos(\theta_1)$ to $\cos(\theta_2)$ without altering the [real power](103c4ff6.md) $P$.

Note that the real power $P$ dissipated by the load is not affected by the power factor correction because the [average power](103c4ff6.md) due to the capacitance is zero.

It is also possible that the load is capacitive; that is, the load is operating at a leading power factor. In this case, an [inductor](8be49ac8.md) should be connected across *(in parallel with)* the load for power factor correction. The value of the required shunt [inductance](8be49ac8.md) $L$ is determined as
