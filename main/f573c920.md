# Euler's Formula

***Euler's formula*** is a mathematical formula in *complex analysis* that establishes the fundamental relationship between the [trigonometric functions](f71f21ec.md) and the [complex](9efce189.md) [exponential function](630a1e01.md).

> ***Euler's formula*** states that for any real number $\theta$,
>
> $\boxed{e^{\displaystyle j\theta} = \cos(\theta) + j\sin(\theta)}$
>
> $\boxed{e^{\displaystyle -j\theta} = \cos(\theta) - j\sin(\theta)}$
>
> where $e$ is the Euler's number (the base of [natural logarithms](3efff0b5.md)) and $j$ is the [imaginary unit](8687c4e6.md).

When $\theta = \pi$, *Euler's formula* may be rewritten as $e^{\displaystyle\,j\pi} = -1$, which is known as ***Euler's identity***.
