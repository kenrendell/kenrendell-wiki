# Source-Free RC Circuit

To find the [natural response](ea5e865c.md) of an *[RC](2abe1de7.md)* circuit, the following is required:

- The initial capacitor voltage $v(0)$.

  > Since the [capacitor](48507115.md) voltage cannot change instantaneously,
  >
  > $\boxed{v\left(0^-\right) = v\left(0^+\right) = v\left(0\right) = V_0}$
  >
  > where $v\left(0^-\right)$ is the voltage across the capacitor just before switching and $v\left(0^+\right)$ is its voltage immediately after switching.

- The time constant $\tau$.

  > The [time constant](ea5e865c.md) $\tau$ for an *RC* circuit is
  >
  > $\boxed{\tau = RC}$
  >
  > where $R$ is the [thevenin](b153529a.md) resistance at the capacitor terminals and $C$ is the equivalent [capacitance](48507115.md).

A source-free *[RC](2abe1de7.md)* circuit occurs when its DC source is suddenly disconnected. The energy already stored in the [capacitor](48507115.md) is released to the [resistors](427b2567.md).

This shows that the [natural response](ea5e865c.md) of the *RC* circuit is an exponential decay of the initial voltage $V_0$.

The [energy](7e3e2f1f.md) that was initially stored in the [capacitor](48507115.md) is eventually dissipated in the [resistor](427b2567.md).
