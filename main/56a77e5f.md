# Frequency Response

At low frequencies, the coupling and bypass [capacitors](48507115.md) can no longer be replaced by the short-circuit approximation because of the increase in [reactance](45a5fbef.md) of these elements.

> The larger capacitors of a system will have an important impact on the response of a system in the low-frequency range and can be ignored for the high-frequency region.

For the smaller capacitors that come into play due to the parasitic capacitances of the device or network, the frequency range of concern will be the higher frequencies.

> The smaller capacitors of a system will have an important impact on the response of a system in the high-frequency range and can be ignored for the low-frequency region.

In the mid-frequency range the effect of the capacitive elements is largely ignored and the amplifier considered ideal and composed simply of resistive elements and controlled sources.
