# Damping

> ***Damping*** is an influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing or preventing its oscillation.

In physical systems, damping is produced by processes that dissipate the [energy](7e3e2f1f.md) stored in the oscillation. Examples include viscous drag in mechanical systems, [resistance](427b2567.md) in [electronic oscillators](ee0de5b3.md), and absorption and scattering of light in optical oscillators.

> The ***damping ratio*** $\zeta$ is a dimensionless measure describing how oscillations in a system decay after disturbance.
>
> $\boxed{\zeta = \frac{\alpha}{\omega_0}}$

> where $\omega_0$ is known as the *resonant frequency* or strictly as the *undamped natural frequency*, expressed in radians per second $(\textrm{rad}/\textrm{s})$; and $\alpha$ is the *[neper](fd7cf1fa.md) frequency* or the *damping factor*, expressed in nepers per second $(\textrm{Np}/\textrm{s})$.

The damping ratio $\zeta$ is a system parameter that can vary from ***undamped*** $(\zeta = 0)$, ***underdamped*** $(0 < \zeta < 1)$ through ***critically damped*** $(\zeta = 1)$ to ***overdamped*** $(\zeta > 1)$. Systems that will oscillate are described as *underdamped* and those that will not are *overdamped*.

The special case of $\zeta = 1$ is called *critical damping* and represents the case of the system that is just on the border of oscillation. It is the minimum damping that can be applied without causing oscillation.
