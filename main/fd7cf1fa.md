# Neper

> The ***neper*** $\textrm{(Np)}$ is a logarithmic unit for ratios of measurements of physical field and power quantities, such as [gain](2f56aca1.md) and loss of electronic signals.

Like the [decibel](2f56aca1.md), the neper is a unit in a logarithmic scale. While the [bel](2f56aca1.md) uses the decadic (base-10) [logarithm](a9e9dea5.md) to compute ratios, the neper uses the [natural logarithm](3efff0b5.md).

The level $L$ of a ratio of two signal amplitudes or root-power quantities, with the unit neper $\textrm{(Np)}$.

> $\boxed{L = \ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)}\quad\textrm{Np}$ 
>
> where $a$ and $b$ are the signal amplitudes.

The level $L$ of a ratio of two power quantities, with the unit neper $\textrm{(Np)}$.

> $\boxed{L = \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)}\quad\textrm{Np}$ 
>
> where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the signal powers.

The decibel $\textrm{(dB)}$ and the neper $\textrm{(Np)}$ have a fixed ratio to each other.

> $\boxed{1\:\textrm{Np} = 20\log_{10}(e)\:\textrm{dB}}$
>
> $\boxed{1\:\textrm{dB} = \frac{1}{20}\ln(10)\:\textrm{Np}}$

Like the [decibel](2f56aca1.md), the neper is a dimensionless unit.
