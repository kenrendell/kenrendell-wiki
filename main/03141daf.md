# Discrete Signals

Discrete signals may arise naturally or as a consequence of sampling continuous signals (typically at a uniform sampling interval $t_s$). A sampled or discrete signal $x[n]$ is just an ordered sequence of values corresponding to the integer index $n$ that embodies the time history of the signal. It contains no direct information about the ***sampling interval*** $t_s$, except through the index $n$ of the sample locations.

A discrete signal $x[n]$ is called ***right-sided*** if it is zero for $n < N$, ***causal*** if it is zero for $n < 0$, ***left-sided*** if it is zero for $n > N$, and ***anti-causal*** if it is zero for $n \geq 0$.

A ***discrete periodic signal*** repeats every $N$ samples.
