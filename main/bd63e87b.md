# Operational Amplifier (Op Amp)

The ***op amp*** is an electronic unit that behaves like a voltage-controlled voltage source. An op amp may also be regarded as a voltage amplifier with very high gain. It can also be used in making a voltage- or current-controlled current source.

> An ***op amp*** is an active circuit element designed to perform mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration.

The five important terminals:

- Inverting input, pin 2.
- Non-inverting input, pin 3.
- Output, pin 6.
- Positive power supply $V^{+}$, pin 7.
- Negative power supply $V^{-}$, pin 4.

> An input applied to the non-inverting terminal will appear with the same polarity at the output, while an input applied to the inverting terminal will appear inverted at the output.

## Powering the Op Amp

The output voltage $v_{o}$ of op amp is dependent on and is limited by the supply voltage $V_{CC}$. Op amp can operate in three modes, depending on the differential input voltage $v_{d}$.

1. Positive saturation, $v_{o} = V_{CC}$.
2. Linear region, $-V_{CC} \le v_{o} \le V_{CC}$.
3. Negative saturation, $v_{o} = -V_{CC}$.

## Applications

The ***op amp*** is a fundamental building block in modern electronic instrumentation. It is used extensively in many devices, along with resistors and other passive elements.
