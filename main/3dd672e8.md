# Complete Response of a Circuit

There are two ways of decomposing the ***complete response*** into two components:

- First is to break it into a *[natural response](ea5e865c.md)* and a *forced response*.

  > $\boxed{\textrm{Complete response } v = \underset{\textrm{(stored energy)}}{\textrm{natural response } v_n} + \underset{\textrm{(independent source)}}{\textrm{forced response } v_f}}$
  >
  > For [RC](4c826631.md) and [RL](999035df.md) circuits, the *natural response* $v_n$ is
  >
  > $\displaystyle v_n = V_0\,e^{\displaystyle -t/\tau}$
  >
  > and *forced response* $v_f$ is
  >
  > $\displaystyle v_f = V_s \left(1 - e^{\displaystyle -t/\tau}\right)$

  The *forced response* $v_f$ is produced by the circuit when an external force (a voltage source in this case) is applied. The *[natural response](ea5e865c.md)* $v_n$ eventually dies out along with the transient component of the *forced reponse* $v_f$, leaving only the steady-state component of the *forced response* $v_f$.

- Second is to break it into a *transient response* and a *steady-state response*.

  > $\boxed{\textrm{Complete response } v = \underset{\textrm{(temporary)}}{\textrm{transient response } v_t} + \underset{\textrm{(permanent)}}{\textrm{steady-state response } v_{ss}}}$
  >
  > For [RC](4c826631.md) and [RL](999035df.md) circuits, the  *transient response* $v_t$ is
  >
  > $\displaystyle v_t = (V_0 - V_s) e^{\displaystyle -t/\tau}$
  >
  > and *steady-state response* $v_{ss}$ is
  >
  > $\displaystyle v_{ss} = V_s$

  The *transient response* $v_t$ is the circuit's temporary response that will die out with time. The *steady-state response* $v_{ss}$ is the behavior of the circuit a long time after an external excitation is applied.

> The first decomposition of the *complete response* is in terms of the source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of the permanency of the responses.
