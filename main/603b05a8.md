# Human Auditory Response

One of the most frequent applications of the [decibel](2f56aca1.md) scale is in the communication and entertainment industries. The human ear responds in a logarithmic fashion to changes in audio power levels.

To establish a basis for comparison between audio levels, a reference level of $20$ micropascals ($\mu\textrm{Pa}$) was chosen. The $20\;\mu\textrm{Pa}$ level is the *threshold level of hearing* ($0\;\textrm{dB}$). Using this reference level, the sound pressure level in [decibels](2f56aca1.md) is defined by the following equation:

> $\boxed{\mathrm{dB}_s = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{P}{20\;\mu\textrm{Pa}}\right)}\quad\textrm{dB}$
>
> where $P$ is the sound pressure in micropascals ($\mu\textrm{Pa}$).

To double the sound level received by the human ear, the power rating of the acoustical source (in watts) must be increased by a factor of 10.

At normal hearing levels, it would take a change of about $3\;\textrm{dB}$ (twice the power level) for the change to be noticeable to the human ear.

At low levels of sound, a change of $2\;\textrm{dB}$ may be noticeable, but it may take a $6\;\textrm{dB}$ (four times the power level) change for much higher levels of sound.
