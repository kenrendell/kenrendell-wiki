# Diac

A ***diac*** (diode for alternating current) is a two-terminal [thyristor](f4c9298e.md) that is equivalent to back-to-back inverse four-layer [diodes](15e62b08.md) that can conduct current in either direction when activated. The right side of the stack can be regarded as a *pnpn* structure with the same characteristics as a four-layer diode, while the left side is an inverted four-layer diode having an *npnp* structure. The two terminals are both anodes ($A_1$ and $A_2$).

Conduction occurs in a diac when the breakover voltage $V_\textrm{BR}$ is reached with either polarity across the two terminals. The device turns off when the current drops below the holding value $I_H$.
