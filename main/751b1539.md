# Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis

Steps to analyze AC circuits:

1. Transform the circuit to the [phasor](82b1dcbd.md) or frequency domain.
2. Solve the problem using circuit techniques. The analysis is performed in the same manner as DC circuit analysis except that complex numbers are involved.
3. Transform the resulting phasor to the time domain.

> Frequency domain analysis of an AC circuit via [phasors](82b1dcbd.md) is much easier than analysis of the circuit in the time domain.
