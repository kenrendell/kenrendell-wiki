# Triac

A ***triac*** (triode for alternating current) is like a [diac](6f448c4c.md) with a gate terminal. A triac can be turned on by a pulse of gate current and does not require the breakover voltage to initiate conduction, as does the diac.

Basically, a triac can be thought of simply as two [SCR](0d801cd6.md)s connected in parallel and opposite directions with a common gate terminal. Unlike the SCR, the triac can conduct current in either direction when it is triggered on, depending on the polarity of the voltage across its $A_1$ and $A_2$ terminals.

As with other [thyristors](f4c9298e.md), the triac ceases to conduct when the anode current drops below the specified value of the holding current $I_H$. The only way to turn off the triac is to reduce the current to a sufficiently low level.
