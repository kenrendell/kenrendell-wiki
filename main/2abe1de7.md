# First-Order Circuits

A circuit comprising a [resistor](427b2567.md) and [capacitor](48507115.md) and a circuit comprising a resistor and an [inductor](8be49ac8.md) are called *RC* and *RL* circuits, respectively. The differential equations resulting from analyzing *RC* and *RL* circuits are of the first-order.

> A ***first-order circuit*** is characterized by a first-order differential equations.

An [op amp](bd63e87b.md) circuit containing a storage element will exhibit first-order behavior. [Differentiators](4c10ed9c.md) and [integrators](99d23403.md) are examples of first-order op amp circuits.
