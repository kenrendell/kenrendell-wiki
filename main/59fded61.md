# Number System

> The ***radix*** (often referred to as ***base***) $r$ of a number system determines the number of distinct values (digits) that can be used to represent any arbitrary number. The ***radix point*** (or *decimal point* when 10 is the radix) distinguishes positive powers (integer part) of $r$ from negative powers (fractional part) of $r$.

In general, using $n$ digits allows representation of positive integers in base $r$ in the range from $0$ to $r^n - 1$ (or $r^n$ possible values).

In general, a number $N$ expressed in a base $r$ system has digits $d$ multiplied by powers of $r$.

## Number-Base Conversion

Representations of a number in a different radix are said to be equivalent if they have the same decimal (base-10) representation.

> For example, $\displaystyle (0011)_8 = (1001)_2$
>
> $\displaystyle 0 \times 8^3 + 0 \times 8^2 + 1 \times 8 + 1 = 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2 + 1 = (9)_{10}$

The conversion of a number in base $r$ to decimal (base-10) is done by expanding the number in a power series and adding all the terms as shown previously. If the number includes a radix point, it is necessary to *separate the number into an integer part and fraction part*, since each part must be converted differently.

### Decimal Integer to a Number in Different Base

The conversion of a decimal integer $N$ to a number in base $r$ is done by *dividing the number and all successive quotients by $r$ and accumulating the remainders*.

> $\boxed{N / r = Q + (d / r)}$
>
> $\boxed{Q = \frac{N - d}{r}}$
>
> $\boxed{d = N - Q \times r}$
>
> where:
>
> - $d$ is the remainder (digit in base $r$) of $N / r$ that ranges in value from $0$ to $r - 1$.
> - $Q$ is the integer quotient of $N / r$.

To convert the decimal integer $N$ to a number in base $r$. First, the decimal integer $N$ is divided by base $r$ to give an integer quotient $Q$ and a remainder $d$. Then, the integer quotient $Q$ is divided by base $r$ to give a new quotient and a remainder. The process is continued until the integer quotient $Q$ becomes 0. The digits of the number in base $r$ are obtained from the *remainders*.

> For example, convert number $N = (153)_{10}$ to a number in base $r = 8$
>
> $\displaystyle Q_0 = \frac{N - d_0}{r} = \frac{153 - d_0}{8} = 19\:\to\:d_0 = N - Q_0 \times r = 153 - 19 \times 8 = 1$
>
> $\displaystyle Q_1 = \frac{Q_0 - d_1}{r} = \frac{19 - d_1}{8} = 2\:\to\:d_1 = Q_0 - Q_1 \times r = 19 - 2 \times 8 = 3$
>
> $\displaystyle Q_2 = \frac{Q_1 - d_2}{r} = \frac{2 - d_2}{8} = 0\:\to\:d_2 = Q_1 - Q_2 \times r = 2 - 0 \times 8 = 2$
>
> $\displaystyle N = (d_{2}d_{1}d_{0})_8 = (231)_8 = (153)_{10}$

### Decimal Fraction to a Number in Different Base

The conversion of a decimal fraction $N$ to a number in base $r$ is done by *multiplying the number and all fraction part of successive products by $r$ and accumulating the integers (integer part of the products)*.

> $\boxed{N \times r = d + F}$
>
> $\boxed{F = (N \times r) - d}$
>
> $\boxed{d = (N \times r) - F}$
>
> where:
>
> - $d$ is the integer part (digit in base $r$) of the product of $N \times r$ that ranges in value from $0$ to $r - 1$.
> - $F$ is the fraction part of the product of $N \times r$.

To convert decimal fraction $N$ to a number in base $r$. First, the decimal fraction $N$ is multiplied by base $r$ to give an integer $d$ and a fraction $F$. Then, the new fraction is multiplied by base $r$ to give a new integer and a new fraction. The process is continued until the fraction becomes 0 or until the number of digits has sufficient accuracy. The digits of the number in base $r$ are obtained from the *integers* (integer part of the products).

> For example, convert number $N = (0.6875)_{10}$ to a number in base $r = 2$
>
> $\displaystyle F_0 = (N \times r) - d_{-1} = (0.6875 \times 2) - d_{-1} = 0.375\:\to\:d_{-1} = (N \times r) - F_0 = (0.6875 \times 2) - 0.375 = 1$
>
> $\displaystyle F_1 = (F_0 \times r) - d_{-2} = (0.375 \times 2) - d_{-2} = 0.75\:\to\:d_{-2} = (F_0 \times r) - F_1 = (0.375 \times 2) - 0.75 = 0$
>
> $\displaystyle F_2 = (F_1 \times r) - d_{-3} = (0.75 \times 2) - d_{-3} = 0.5\:\to\:d_{-3} = (F_1 \times r) - F_2 = (0.75 \times 2) - 0.5 = 1$
>
> $\displaystyle F_3 = (F_2 \times r) - d_{-4} = (0.5 \times 2) - d_{-4} = 0\:\to\:d_{-4} = (F_2 \times r) - F_3 = (0.5 \times 2) - 0 = 1$
>
> $\displaystyle N = (0.d_{-1}d_{-2}d_{-3}d_{-4})_2 = (0.1011)_2 = (0.6875)_{10}$
