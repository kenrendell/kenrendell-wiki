# Thyristors (PNPN Devices)

A ***thyristor*** is a solid-state semiconductor device with four layers of alternating *p*-type and *n*-type materials used for high-power applications. It acts exclusively as a bistable switch (or a latch), conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, and continuing to conduct until the voltage across the device is reversed-bias, or until the voltage is removed (by some other means).
